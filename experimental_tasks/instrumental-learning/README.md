## Instrumental learning task

This is a child-friendly version of the instrumental learning task used by Pessiglione et al. (2006).

### Instructions

In order to run, make sure the script `ilt2.m` and the folders 'img' and 'functions' are in teh current working directory. You may also want to check that the screen settings (monitors width and viewing distance); these are currently set to these defaults

```{matlab}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% Screen setup info: change these accordingto the monitor and viewing distance used
scr.subDist = 90;   % subject distance (cm)
scr.width   = 300;  % monitor width (mm)
```

Setting these to match your setup ensure that the size of stimuli appears as intended.

In order to run this type `ilt2` in the coomand line. You will be then asked to type in some information, and whether you would like to see the "intro" (this is a short guided demonstration of the task that was used to more easily explain it to children). It should look like this:

```
>> ilt2

 Subject number (set 0 to test without storing data):  1


   Please type the following informations
        initials / identifier:  ML
        age:  99
        gender (m/f):  m
